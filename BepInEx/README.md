ACCRETION
=========
**NOTE: If you are updating the modpack, you will need to delete your profile in your mod manager and download the modpack again. This is a limitation of the way Thunderstore handles modpacks and there is nothing I can do about it.**

***ACCRETION*** is an expansion and overhaul modpack for Risk of Rain 2. The aim of the modpack is to add highly polished new content to the game, while improving the vanilla experience to a significant degree. Careful attention has been paid to the balance between individual mods and to providing an out of the box high quality experience for all players.

This modpack is intended to be played from either an existing save or a brand new save. New players to the game should ideally have an experience that is at least as stable as vanilla, while still being able to unlock everything they would normally be able to unlock. Veteran players will find a significant amount of new content and changes to play around with.

Currently adds:
- 5 Survivors.
- 60+ Items.
- 19 Artifacts.
- 3 Enemies.
- 6 Difficulties.
- 30+ Skins.
- Offline Prismatic Trials.

Many of the changes come from the excellent RiskyMod by Moffein. The changes have been mirrored in the full changelog below, but you are encouraged to check out the mod on the Thunderstore, which also links to a full changelog that goes into further detail about the design philosophy of the overhaul.

Additionally, many other tweaks are not listed for one reason or another. Be sure to check out the full list of mods and their individual pages for more information. A huge thank you to all of the mod creators who have contributed to making this expansion what it is.

DISABLING INDIVIDUAL MODS

To disable individual mods, first disable Accretion (the main Modpack). You should then be able to disable any individual mods as you wish.

CONTACT
----
If you would like to report bugs, make suggestions, or have any other feedback, I can be reached on Discord at Polly#8281. I am also in the Risk of Rain 2 Modding discord. Although I have tested the pack extensively myself, there are likely to be many bugs and balancing issues I overlooked. I will attempt to fix any bugs I can as soon as possible.

I donâ€™t play multiplayer a whole lot, so I have some difficulty testing multiplayer. If you encounter any bugs or oddities, please let me know.

I am also interested in working with an experienced mod creator on adding some additional content and tweaks to the pack. If you are willing to work with me, please let me know.
