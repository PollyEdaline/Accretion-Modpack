ACCRETION
=========
**NOTE: If you are updating the modpack, you will need to delete your profile in your mod manager and download the modpack again. This is a limitation of the way Thunderstore handles modpacks and there is nothing I can do about it.**

**This modpack takes a long time to start up. There is nothing I can do about this, just be patient!**

***ACCRETION*** is an expansion and overhaul modpack for Risk of Rain 2, which adds loads of new content and overhauls base game mechanics, enemies, items, and survivors. New players to the game can enjoy everything the base game has to offer, in a complete, polished package. Veteran players can enjoy discovering changes, playing new survivors, and being surprised by new additions. The goal of this modpack is to feel as if you haven't modded anything at all, but woke up one day to find a new expansion had been released for the game.

Currently adds:
- A few new survivors.
- Tons of new items.
- A bunch of new Artifacts to tackle.
- A few extra enemies and bosses.
- A whole ton of new skins from talented artists.
- New difficulties, including the deadly Inferno difficulty.
- Offline Prismatic Trials.
- A new Scavenger Bingo mode.

If you enjoy this modpack, please consider donating to the mod authors, or to myself. Maintaining the pack takes far more effort than you might think, but it would be nothing without the hard work of all the mod authors and contributors. My donation link can be found near the top of the page, and the same can be said for any individual mod authors on their pages.

Many of the changes to the base game come from the excellent RiskyMod by Moffein. The changes have been mirrored in the full changelog below, but you are encouraged to check out the mod on the Thunderstore, which also links to a full changelog that goes into further detail about the design philosophy of the overhaul.

CONTACT
-------
If you would like to report bugs, make suggestions, or have any other feedback, please let me know at the [itch.io community](https://pollychan.itch.io/accretion-modpack/community). Although I have tested the pack extensively myself, there are likely to be many bugs and balancing issues I overlooked. I will attempt to fix any bugs I can as soon as possible. I donâ€™t play multiplayer a whole lot, so I have some difficulty testing multiplayer. If you encounter any bugs or oddities, please let me know.

You can post on the [itch.io community](https://pollychan.itch.io/accretion-modpack/community) if you have any feedback or bug reports, or find others to play with. There is also a [Github](https://github.com/PollyEdaline/Accretion-Modpack) if you would prefer to post issues there.

I am also interested in working with an experienced mod creator on adding some additional content and tweaks to the pack. If you are willing to work with me, please let me know.
